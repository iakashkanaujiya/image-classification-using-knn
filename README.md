# Image Classification using KNN

Classify the image using KNN algorithm: KNN is a simplest machine learning algorithm used for classification.

### Run the following command

```
npm postinstall
```

This command will install the npm modules, and generates the dataset and extract the features from the dataset, and train the model.

Currentely this ML algorithm has the accuracy of the 42.6%, because of the poor dataset. But, I will further improve this.

This project, does not use any external Machine Learning library. Everything is here implement from the scratch.
